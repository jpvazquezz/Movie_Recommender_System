            Based on the [TMDB 5000 movies dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata),
            this movie recommender was built using movies metadata, namely the top 3 actors, the director, the related genres and movies plot keywords,
            to generate a list of 10 recommended movies. The recommendation itself derives from the cosine similarity score that the inputed movie
            has in relation to the other movies in the dataset.
            
            Its author is JP Vazquez, an aspiring data scientist. The app's creation was motivated by pedagogical reasons,
            since the knowdledge about a recommendation system is very important to any data scientist's work.
