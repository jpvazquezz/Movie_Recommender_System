# Movie_Recommender_System
Based on the [TMDB 5000 movies dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata), this movie recommender was built using movies metadata, namely the top 3 actors, the director, the related genres and movies plot keywords, to generate a list of 10 recommended movies. The recommendation itself derives from the cosine similarity score that the inputed movie has in relation to the other movies in the dataset.
